# Can of Books

**Author**: Roger Reyes and Kyle Honaker
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview

This application sends out a query request to the backend server. On mount the home page will render a Carousel displaying information about the books taken from the cloud database.

## Getting Started

A user must set up the front and back end of their client and server and connect them using a GET request. They must also have a MongoDB database set up in order to write, store, and read information to the database.

## Architecture

The front end client will do a GET request to the server on Mount. The server will pull the information from the MongoDB and send it back to the client. The client will then check to see that the information has populated and insert the details into the Carousel.
